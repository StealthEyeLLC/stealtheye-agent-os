# Evals

## Philosophy

Every significant behavior should be measurable through evals. Failures become regression cases, not anecdotes.

## Failure-to-eval loop

When the system fails, add an eval that reproduces the failure, documents expected behavior, and verifies the repair.

## Eval families

- Regression evals for known failure modes.
- Mission success evals for end-to-end task completion.
- Tool selection evals for correct routing and refusal.
- Security evals for hard stops and authority enforcement.
- Prompt injection and tool poisoning evals for untrusted content.
- CI repair evals for diagnosis and safe remediation.
- Browser QA evals for screenshots, traces, and non-destructive validation.
- Receipt accuracy evals for complete, replayable evidence.

## Evidence

Each eval should declare fixtures, allowed tools, expected receipts, success criteria, and forbidden shortcuts.
